## Just show me the code already

Okay! Here's how I did it:
[site/src/pages/api/img/bordered.tsx](https://github.com/with-heart/with-heart.xyz/blob/main/site/src/pages/api/img/bordered.tsx)

Think you can do it better?
[Open a PR!](https://github.com/with-heart/with-heart.xyz) I'd love to explore
it with you üíï

## What's a social card?

By themselves, links are pretty boring. They're just some text that points at a
page somewhere on the Internet.

With social cards (generated from [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) data), links
become like online business cards for our sites. They allow us to bring our
links to life by attaching a title, description, and image to our links to make
them beautiful (and noticeable).

The title, description, and image are specified by `meta` tags in a page's
`head`. This means that each page can have its own unique social card!

## What's so great about `@vercel/og`?

While each page can have a unique social card, it can be quite a burden to then
create an image for each page.

That's where
[`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation)
comes in!

`@vercel/og` is a library that allows us to create an
[API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) that generates an
image using JSX and a subset of CSS.

And the coolest part is that since it's just another route, we can dynamically
alter the generated image by attaching search parameters to the URL
(`/api/img/bordered?title=Title&description=Description`).

Let's play with an example!

I used `@vercel/og` to build a bordered image endpoint. It uses the `title` and
`description` search params to dynamically generate the text. The emoji border
is randomized each time the image is generated.

Change the title and description fields and watch as the image and search params
update automatically! New images might take a bit to generate, so please be
patient! ‚ù§Ô∏è

import {EditableImg} from '../editable-img'

<EditableImg defaultTitle="Title" defaultDescription="Description" />

Isn't that so fun‚ÄΩ

## How to generate an image

Now that we've experienced how fun and powerful `@vercel/og` is, let's use it to
build ourselves an endpoint!

First up, we need to install it: `pnpm i @vercel/og` (replace `pnpm` with your
package manager of choice)

We'll use `/api/img/basic` as our URL, so next we'll create
`pages/api/img/basic.tsx`.

Now we'll add a `default` export of a function that returns an `ImageResponse`
called with some JSX. We'll also configure the endpoint to use the
`experimental-edge` runtime which is required for `@vercel/og`.

```tsx title="pages/api/img/basic.tsx"
import {ImageResponse} from '@vercel/og'

export const config = {
  runtime: 'experimental-edge',
}

export default function BasicImg() {
  return new ImageResponse(<div>Hello World</div>)
}
```

<JoinCode />

<Image
  src="/api/img/basic"
  width={1200}
  height={630}
  alt="Hello World in very tiny text compared to the size of the image as a whole"
/>

Wow, that's a big image with almost nothing in it!

By default, `@vercel/og` generates images at a size of 1200x630. If we want to
change that, we can supply the `width` and `height` options to `ImageResponse`:

```tsx highlight {2-3}
export default function BasicImg() {
  return new ImageResponse(<div>Hello World</div>, {
    width: 400,
    height: 200,
  })
}
```

<JoinCode />

<Image
  src="/api/img/basic?step=2"
  width={400}
  height={200}
  alt="Hello World that's as small as the last image except the image is much smaller relative to the size of the text"
/>

That's a little better but there's still not much to it.

Let's add a few improvements:

- make the font larger
- center the text horizontally and vertically
- add a white background
- add a black border

```tsx highlight {4-12}
export default function BasicImg() {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          fontSize: 120,
          backgroundColor: 'white',
          border: '1px solid black',
        }}
      >
        Hello World
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 400,
      height: 200,
    },
  )
}
```

<JoinCode />

<Image src="/api/img/basic?step=3" width={400} height={200} />

Neat! It's just like plain ol' CSS-in-JS. Which is great if you're a CSS-in-JS
person, but not so great if you're not.

If you're not one of those people, you're in luck because there's not much to
it!

Things are styled using a `style` object where the keys are the same `display`-
and `max-width`-type attributes you're used to, except camelcased (`maxWidth`).

And the values are strings unless they're a number but also numbers can be
strings too if you want, because CSS is a very forgiving language üôè

One other thing to note about the above image is that the outer container needs
to have a `width` and `height` of `100%` in order for `flex` to center the text:

```tsx highlight {3-4}
<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    fontSize: 120,
    backgroundColor: 'white',
    border: '1px solid black',
  }}
>
  Hello World
</div>
```

There are also a few other differences we need to be aware of! The underlying
library that `@vercel/og` uses to generate the images is
[`@vercel/satori`](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

Satori handles only a subset of the CSS spec. It includes common features, but
it's limited in many ways (like `flex` and `none` being the only options for
`display`). The Satori README
[contains a table with the supported properties](https://github.com/vercel/satori#css).

If you plan to use `@vercel/og`, be sure to look through the table to get a
better understanding of what you can and cannot do with it.

Since it's just JSX, we can create components! Let's refactor the code we have
so far as two components: `Container` and `Text`

```tsx
import type {ReactNode} from 'react'

const Container = ({children}: {children: ReactNode}) => (
  <div
    style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
      display: 'flex',
      alignItems: 'center',
      justifyContent: 'center',
      backgroundColor: 'white',
      border: '1px solid black',
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
)

const Text = ({children}: {children: ReactNode}) => (
  <div
    style={{
      fontSize: 64,
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
)

export default function BasicImg() {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <Container>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
      </Container>
    ),
    {
      width: 400,
      height: 200,
    },
  )
}
```

<JoinCode />

<Image src="/api/img/basic?step=4" width={400} height={200} />

Serving components as an image as an API response. Yum!

There's lots more to explore like automatically rendering different emoji sets,
custom fonts, and more!

Unfortunately, I'm out of time and energy for this page at the moment. Maybe
I'll add more content later!
