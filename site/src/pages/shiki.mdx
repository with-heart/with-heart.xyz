## What is `shiki-twoslash`?

[`shiki-twoslash`] is a library that combines the functionality of two
libraries:

- [`shiki`]: a syntax highlighter that produces HTML that looks just like code
  in VS Code
- [`twoslash`]: a markup syntax for TypeScript code blocks powered by the
  TypeScript compiler (used by the TypeScript website)

`shiki-twoslash` allows us to produce TypeScript code blocks that are as
beautiful as they are powerful:

```ts twoslash
const isString = (x: unknown): x is string => typeof x === 'string'
const isNumber = (x: unknown): x is number => typeof x === 'number'
const isBoolean = (x: unknown): x is boolean => typeof x === 'boolean'

declare const thing: unknown

if (isString(thing)) {
  thing
  // ^?
} else if (isNumber(thing)) {
  thing
  // ^?
} else if (isBoolean(thing)) {
  thing
  // ^?
}
```

(Be sure to hover over the code block above to see the TypeScript
compiler-powered goodness)

This functionality enables us to bring otherwise boring and static code blocks
to life!

Let's take a look at how to add it to your MDX-powered blog and how to use it!

## Markup

`shiki-twoslash` hides a significant amount of complexity behind a few types of
markup. In this section, we'll look at how to use some of them.

By the way, in order to use these `twoslash` features, you need to create a code
block inside a `ts twoslash` fence:

````
```ts twoslash
// TypeScript compiler-driven code goes here!
```
````

### Queries

Queries allow us to query the TypeScript compiler for information.

#### `^?`

The `^?` query tells the TypeScript compiler to display tooltip information
about the identifier above that `^` is pointing at.

````
```ts twoslash
const person = 'piablo'
//    ^?
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
const person = 'piablo'
//    ^?
```

````
```ts twoslash
const addOne = (n: number) => n + 1
//    ^?
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
const addOne = (n: number) => n + 1
//    ^?
```

#### `^|`

The `^?` query tells the TypeScript compiler to display an autocomplete dropdown
at the point that `^` points to.

It requires the use of a `// @noErrors` comment at the top of the block.

````
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const string = 'hello world'
'hello'.to
//        ^|
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const string = 'hello world'
'hello'.to
//        ^|
```

### Highlighting code

`shiki-twoslash` can highlight specific lines of code by attaching line numbers
to the code fence:

````
```ts twoslash {1, 3}
const highlightedLine = {
  notHighlighted: true,
  highlighted: true,
}
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash {1, 3}
const highlightedLine = {
  notHighlighted: true,
  highlighted: true,
}
```

### Displaying errors

`shiki-twoslash` can render inline errors produced by the TypeScript compiler.

By default, Shiki will throws an error and displays a debug component for
TypeScript compiler errors. This helps protect us from writing incorrect code
samples.

For example, if we try to render the following code block:

````
```ts twoslash
const addOne = (n: number) => n + 1
addOne('hello!')
```
````

The code sample would throw a type error (because we can't use `hello!` as a
`number`):

```
Errors were thrown in the sample, but not included in an errors tag

These errors were not marked as being expected: 2345.
Expected: // @errors: 2345
```

`shiki-twoslash` helpfully explains exactly how to resolve the issue:
`// @error: 2345`

Let's add that to our code sample:

````
```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
const addOne = (n: number) => n + 1
addOne('hello!')
```
````

And now it renders the error inline:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
const addOne = (n: number) => n + 1
addOne('hello!')
```

### Hiding irrelevant code

`shiki-twoslash` offers the `---cut---` markup which allows us to hide all of
the code before that line in the produced code sample.

This allows us to write _correct_ code (code that can be compiled) while only
showing part of the code, or to avoid repeating the same code across multiple
code samples.

Here's an example:

````
```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}
// ---cut---
const bluePanda: User = {
  name: 'BluePanda',
}
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}
// ---cut---
const bluePanda: User = {
  name: 'BluePanda',
}
```

This is helpful if you're iteratively telling a story about some code by
introducing parts across multiple code blocks:

```ts twoslash
// first we define our type...
interface User {
  name: string
}
```

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}

// then we assign it to a variable...
const user: User = {name: 'BluePanda'}
```

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}

const user: User = {name: 'BluePanda'}

// now we have a user with a `name`!
console.log(user.name)
```

Did we really need to include the definition for `User` in every code block?

To make the compiler happy? Yes.

For our readers? Nah.

If we used `---cut---` instead:

````
```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}

const user: User = {name: 'BluePanda'}
// ---cut---

// now we have a user with a `name`!
console.log(user.name)
```
````

The compiler is happy and we only see the relevant code:

```ts twoslash
interface User {
  name: string
}

const user: User = {name: 'BluePanda'}
// ---cut---

// now we have a user with a `name`!
console.log(user.name)
```

If you think `---cut---` is useful, wait till you see the next section!

### Reusing code blocks

`shiki-twoslash` gives us the ability to create virtual code blocks that can be
fully or partially re-used within other code blocks.

To reuse a block, use `twoslash include <name>` (notice that lack of `ts`) in
the block's code fence:

````
```twoslash include box
interface Box<T> {
  thing: T
}
```
````

Then reference the block by name using `@include` in a `ts twoslash` block:

````
```ts twoslash
// @include: box
```
````

If used correctly, we see the `Box` definition:

```twoslash include box
interface Box<T> {
  thing: T
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: box
```

`shiki-twoslash` treats the included code like it's part of the code block it's
imported into!

This means we can use the included code and `---cut---` to make the compiler
happy without showing the included code.

````
```ts twoslash
// @include: box
// ---cut---
const box: Box<string> = {thing: 'hello!'}
```
````

<JoinCode />

```ts twoslash
// @include: box
// ---cut---
const box: Box<string> = {thing: 'hello!'}
```

We can also include only part of a code sample by using `// - <location-name>`

````
```twoslash include main
type Scream<T extends string> = Uppercase<T>
// - scream
type Whisper<T extends string> = Lowercase<T>
// - both
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main-scream
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main-both
```
````

<JoinCode />

```twoslash include main
type Scream<T extends string> = Uppercase<T>
// - scream
type Whisper<T extends string> = Lowercase<T>
// - both
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main-scream
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main-both
```
