## Terminal

### `alias`

Alias one thing to another thing.

```sh
> alias hello="echo hello"

> hello
hello
```

If you save this line in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file, `hello` will be
available in all new terminal sessions. To make it available in your current
session too, see [Sourcing changes to rc files](#sourcing-changes)

### `ls`

List the files in the current directory.

You can install [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) for a modern replacement:

```sh
brew install exa
```

I alias `ls` to `exa` so that I always use `exa`. You can do the same by adding
the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```sh
alias ls=exa
```

You'll also need to
[`source` the changes to the file](#using-changes-in-zshrc-or-bashrc-in-the-current-terminal)
if you want the alias to work in your current terminal.

### `cd`

**c**hange **d**irectory. Changes your directory to a different one.

```sh
~
> cd code

~/code
>
```

If you type part of a file or directory name and press <kbd>tab</kbd>, you'll
trigger autocomplete which will attempt to find to expand your current input to
the first matched filename.

```sh
> ls
a_file b_file

> ls a<tab>
# hitting tab there replaces the input line with:
> ls a_file
```

If you use `zsh`, you can use tab to complete nested partial matches:

```sh
> ls -T
.
└── site
   └── src
      └── pages
         ├── api
         │  └── hello.ts
         └── index.tsx

> ls s/s/p/a/h[tab]
# hitting tab there replaces the input line with:
> ls site/src/pages/api/hello.ts
```

### `pwd`

**p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory aka "where am I?". Shows your current
location in the file system.

```sh
~
> pwd
/Users/with-heart
```

### `which`

Shows you what/where the target command is.

```sh
> which ls
ls: aliased to exa

> which exa
/opt/homebrew/bin/exa
```

### `mkdir`

Creates a directory in the current directory.

```sh
> mkdir new-directory
```

Kind of sucks by default because it can't create nested directories:

```sh
> mkdir some/nested/directory
mkdir: some/nested: No such file or directory
```

However it has this nice little flag `-p` that makes it handle nested
directories. I think that should be the default option, so I made it that way on
my local system:

```sh
> alias mkdir="mkdir -p"
> mkdir some/nested/directory
```

### `touch`

Create an empty file.

```sh
> touch some_file
```

### `rm`

Remove the target file/directory.

```zsh
# files:
> rm some_file

# directories:
# we need `-r` flag (recursive) for directories + `-f` flag (force) to delete
# all files/directories under the target without asking for confirmation
> rm -rf some_directory
```

### Sourcing changes to rc files

If you've modified your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` file and want to see changes in the
current terminal: `source .zshrc` or `source .bashrc`.
