# <GrowLove /> GrowLove

A digital garden tended by [`with-heart`](https://github.com/with-heart).

The content in this garden is forever growing, never quite complete. It evolves
as I evolve. No expectations.

I want this to be a collection of love letters to so many things I enjoy and
rely on like open source, React, TypeScript, XState, component libraries, & all
sorts of fantastic shit like that.

And I also want to be open and honest about mental health. I've spent most of my
adult life depressed and I'm _so_ fucking tired of living that way. I need to
heal by writing and sharing and allowing others in. I hope that it might help
some of yall too! üå±‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
