# <GrowLove /> GrowLove

A digital garden tended by [`with-heart`](https://github.com/with-heart).

The content in this garden is forever growing, never quite complete. It evolves
as I evolve. No expectations.

Featuring open source, React, TypeScript, XState, component libraries, & all
sorts of fantastic shit like that.
